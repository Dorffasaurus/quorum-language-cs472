/*The TextBuilder class allows text to be built up into a buffer. It can be used 
to optimized a set of especially operations for appending text more quickly 
than through repeated concatenation. To use it, you can first create a TextBuilder. Then, optionally, set the max size of the buffer you would like. From there, you can append text values to the buffer and return the value with ToText.
